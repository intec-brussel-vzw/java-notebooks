    " pickling?\n",
    "    Pickling is the serializing and de-serializing of python objects to a byte stream. Unpicking is the opposite.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Pickling is used to store python objects. This means things like lists, dictionaries, class objects, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, you will find pickling to be most useful with data analysis, where you are performing routine tasks on the data, such as pre-processing. Also, it makes a lot of sense when you're working with Python-specific data types, such as dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we use pickling in the NLTK tutorial series to save our trained machine learning algorithm. This is so that, every time we want to use it, we do not need to constantly re-train it, which takes a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Instead, we just train the algorithm once, store it to a variable (an object), and then we pickle it. In the case of the NLTK module, generating the classifiers every time was taking 5-15+ minutes. With pickle, it was taking about 5 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a large dataset, for example, and you're loading that massive data set into memory every time you run the program, it may make a lot of sense to just pickle it, and then load that instead, because it will be far faster, again by 50 - 100x, sometimes far more depending on the size."
